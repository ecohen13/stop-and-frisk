# Stop and Frisk Data Analysis

This represents the submission for our APMA4990: Modeling Social Data final project. The project was completed by Zach Gleicher, Matt Piccolella, and Edo Roth.

## Using this Directory
Inside of this repository are several directories and files:

```
├── analysis/ - R code to do our analysis
├── bin/ - various executables, mostly for data pruning
├── data/ - data which we analyze
├── output/ - graphs/data output by our analysis
├── v11n/ - d3.js visualizations of our data
|   └── data/ - data specifically for our web visualizations 
├── report.{md,pdf} - final project report
└── run.sh - executable to run all of our code
```

This represents all of the code that we wrote and writing that we did for our project.

## Running our Code
To run all of our code, simply run:

```
$ ./run.sh
```

**Note**: since our project has several parts, some of which are quite time intensive, this may take somewhere between 10-15 minutes.

## Output
Our output is contained in the `output/` directory, and looks as follows:

```
├── output/ 
|   └── data/ - data specifically for our web visualizations 
|   └── data/ - data specifically for our web visualizations 
|   └── data/ - data specifically for our web visualizations 
|   └── data/ - data specifically for our web visualizations 
|   └── data/ - data specifically for our web visualizations 
|   └── data/ - data specifically for our web visualizations 
|   └── data/ - data specifically for our web visualizations 
```
